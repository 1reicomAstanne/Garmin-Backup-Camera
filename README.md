# Garmin Backup Camera
  
My Garmin BC40 backup camera worked well for few years. Now it stopped showing video. It gives error message something like " Camera could not connect, please check batteries or connection"..
I replaced batteries but still no luck. I repaired it in Blu-tooth, but still not showing videos. It keeps trying connection and then fails with the same message. Beside replacing batteries, re-syncing Blue-tooth and doing reset on my Garmin Smartdrive 61, I have no I idea how to fix it. I will appreciate your advice.
 
Mine is also a couple of years old and works perfect fine on my DS55. I did do a reset on the DS55 once after a new map install and it deleted the BC40 camera alignment. What waste of time having to set it all up again. Check out this link, maybe it needs a software update?

Your camera may have a weak wireless connection to your navigation device if it takes a long time to display video on the navigation device, if the video frequently pauses or buffers, or if the camera does not display video at all on your navigation device. Interference with the connection can be caused by other wireless signals, vehicle wiring, or structural elements of your vehicle.
 
Move the navigation device to a different location on your dash or windshield.
Remove the camera from the mount, flip it upside down, and place it back into the mount.
When mounted with the Garmin logo upside-down, the camera automatically flips the video the next time it connects to your navigation device to provide a correctly oriented image. Flipping the camera upside down changes the position of the wireless antenna and can improve the connection quality in some cases.
 
Mount the camera at a different location on your license plate.
For example, if your camera is mounted at the top of your license plate, you can try moving it to the bottom of the license plate, or vice-versa.

It is interesting that two people in this thread that have had issues, rookie8155 & chickenhawks, both are from Canada and Garmin specifically recommends lithium batteries in cold climates. So maybe just a longshot but make sure your batteries are either the correct ones or at least warm when trying to make the connection.
 
I used brand new lithium batteries and they would previously last months. But one day it just suddenly stopped connecting, and I could never get it working again. I tried it at every distance possible, on and off the vehicle, and on hot days and cold. No difference.
 
It just became a lot of money to spend on a new one with minimal benefits and no guarantees a new one would work. I just gave up. (And I am the world's most prolific tinkerer, and it is rare to just give up for me.)
 
Thanks all for your advice and feedback. Looks like this camera is dead. I have always used lithium batteries for this camera from day one. So it is not a battery issue but something else. I don't want to buy another one again. It lasted only 2-3 years.
 
Call Gamin to find out how to do it for your GPS. They helped me do it and fixed a problem I couldn't solve.The manual on page 21 states "Resetting the Device
You can reset your device if it stops functioning.
Hold the power key for 12 seconds."
 
Having said that, the Garmin website has other directions at -US/?faq=qg44KCGmEk0CqPVNU5ECi7.... Go down near the bottom and click on Master Reset where it reads "Start with the device turned off and unplugged from power
 
When the first copyright screen appears press and hold the lower right-hand corner of the display portion of the touchscreen
Remove your finger from the touchscreen when "Erase all user data?" appears
 
Note: A master reset may erase the data that is used to locate satellites. Your device may take 3-5 minutes to acquire a satellite signal while outdoors after updating the software or performing a master reset.
 
Thanks for your advice again. Today, when I was testing it again I got message that camera batteries are depleted. These were new batteries I used from my stock. I am going to buy new lithium batteries today and try it again..

Update: I purchased new batteries and replaced them but it still gives same message that batteries are depleted. I will call Garmin. today as a last resort.I think the unit takes (2) batteries. Probably a stupid suggestion on my part, but be sure they are installed with the correct polarity.

It pairs with Garmin unit but does not show video.

It pairs with Garmin unit but does not show video.The Garmin manual says that when you insert batteries the BC-40 is automatically placed in pairing mode and this is indicated by a flashing blue LED. Pairing mode is sustained for about 5 minutes during which you have to do the connection from the navigation device. Do you get the flashing blue LED?
 
Yes, there is no problem in Bluetooth pairing. I have paired it at least twenty times in the last one week or so. The issue is video. It does not show video, it tries to load it then gives error. So the issue is video, Bluetooth paring still works.
 
Thanks John and Wil01 for your suggestions. I will attempt factory reset on my Garmin DriveSmart 61. I have to figure out on how to do factory reset on this device. The one I always do is juts data erase which I think does not reset everything.
 
Good Luck! The manual is at \_35784563\_1486043523\_1518\_1841.p.... Reset is covered on page 21 (as the manual is numbered) but just seems to be holding down the power button for 12 seconds.Thank you so much for your help and finding the information. Unfortunately, holding the power button for 12 only reboots the device and does not do any reset. Looks like Garmin did not provide correct information here.Try the procedure I also found and posted Friday 2/18, should be near the top of the page.
 
Thanks jackrabbit000 for your advice.
Today, I called Garmin Support. After discussing with me everything I did so far, he could not offer anymore support on this issue but he offered replacement camera for $120 Canadian. The condition that I have to ship my defective camera first. Now, I have to decide, should I go for it or not?
What you guys think?

What you guys think?A search on eBay seems to indicate CA $120 is a decent but not great deal. See \_from=R40&\_nkw=garmin+bc+40+w.... A new unit can be had for US$ 145 at -bc-40.... But what if you buy a new unit and it doesn't work, indicating the GPS "receiver" has a fault of some type?
 
You have two devices that can't communicate so it probably is worthwhile checking the Bluetooth on the DS 61 with a smartphone to make sure the problem isn't with the DS 61.There is no Bluetooth issue because both devices pair without any issue. It is the video which is not showing on Garmin DS61.
 
Personally, I would go for it. Let us know what happens. Mine was exactly the same as yours, and I tried EVERYTHING suggested, including the full factory reset. It paired okay but would never show video. It said "batteries depleted" same as yours. It worked one day and not the next.
 
Had a 30 backup cam mounted on the vehicle number plate and after a some time it did the same - no video. Garmin Support was of no help, because I did not buy it directly from Garmin..
Decided to buy another and try it (if the same problem then I would return it); that one worked, so I guessed that it most likely was a lens problem.
Now I mount the new back upcam IN the vehicle, it gives about the same view as if on the vehicle plate.

The BC 40 wireless backup camera is compatible with the Garmin GPS navigators below, provided the operating range between them does not exceed 26 feet (7.93 meters). This range can be further reduced by certain environmental factors. See Environmental Interference with the BC 40:
 
You can pair up to four backup cameras with a compatible Garmin navigation device. If you have already paired the maximum number of cameras, you must unpair one before you can pair another one. One will display by default. You can cycle through the video feeds from all paired cameras. See your camera's owner's manual for information about pairing multiple backup cameras and setting the default.
